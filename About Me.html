        <p class="About Me"> About Me</p>
    </h2>
    <p>I am originally a student at university in the field of bioengineering. I have been designing various jewelry for
        four years. I have progressed a lot in my jewelry journey, which I started as a hobby on a summer vacation. I am
        progressing every day by improving myself in this field. Nowadays, jewelry design has become a serious pleasure
        for me and I finally decided to sell the jewelry I made. I hope you like my products.</p>
